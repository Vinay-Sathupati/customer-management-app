![Express](https://img.shields.io/badge/API-Express-red)
- Node.js
- Express.js
- CORS for cross-origin requests
- sqlite3 for database access
- nodemon for server auto-reloading

### 💽 Database
![SQLite](https://img.shields.io/badge/Database-SQLite3-lightgrey)
- SQLite (with `sqlite3` and `sqlite` packages)
- Used **SQLite CLI** to create and manage tables directly and generate the `.db` file (`customersInfo.db`), which is accessed by the Node.js backend via the `sqlite3` and `sqlite` packages.

`customersInfo.db` has two tables: one for `customers` and one for their `addresses`.

### `customers` Table Schema



| Column      | Type    | Constraints               | Description              |
|-------------|---------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| id          | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT | Unique identifier        |
| first_name  | TEXT    | NOT NULL                  | Customer's first name    |
| last_name   | TEXT    | NOT NULL                  | Customer's last name     |
| phone_number| TEXT    | NOT NULL UNIQUE           | Customer's phone number  |

### `addresses` Table Schema

| Column         | Type    | Constraints               | Description              |
|----------------|---------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| id             | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT | Unique identifier        |
| customer_id    | INTEGER | FOREIGN KEY (customers)   | Links to the customer    |
| address_details| TEXT    | NOT NULL                  | Street, building, etc.   |
| city           | TEXT    | NOT NULL                  | City name                |
| state          | TEXT    | NOT NULL                  | State name               |
| pin_code       | TEXT    | NOT NULL                  | Postal/ZIP code          |


This structure creates a **one-to-many relationship**:  
👉 One customer can have multiple addresses.
